# 🧠 Breast Cancer Detection using Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## 📌 Objective
Build a robust machine learning model using Support Vector Machines to classify breast tumors as benign or malignant.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
Python, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, SHAP, joblib

## 📊 Key Features
- EDA with visualizations: distribution plots, correlation heatmap, feature boxplots
- Multiple SVM kernels: Linear, RBF, Polynomial, Sigmoid
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- PCA for 2D visualization of decision boundary
- SHAP for model interpretability
- All results saved as images and CSV files
